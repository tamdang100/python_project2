# **Project 2**

Suppose you are a Data Analyst in an e-wallet company, and you need to analyze the following datasets:
-	payment_report.csv (monthly payment volume of products)
-	product.csv (product information)
-	transactions.csv (transactions information)
  
You need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the datasets and then conduct data wrangling.

Please see the file '[**Project2.ipynb**](https://github.com/tamdang100/python_project2/blob/main/Project2.ipynb)' along with the CSV datasets [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/179lmdQ39lrUaSDfvNNX37L9fKevNqylk?usp=sharing).
