Suppose you are a DA in an e-wallet company, and you need to analyze the following datasets:
-	payment_report.csv (monthly payment volume of products)
-	product.csv (product information)
-	transactions.csv (transactions information)
  
You need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the datasets and then conduct data wrangling.

Please see the file "Project2.ipynb" along with the csv datasets above.
